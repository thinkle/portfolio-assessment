Step 1: Hello World
- Get GAS-based API set-up (x)
- Get Get web-app authenticated to API * CORS trouble -> maybe JSONP is the solution??? (it is!) (x)
- Get single request made: e.g. list classes for a teacher. (X)
- Test posting data back to GAS api (no-go -- limit of ~5k characters)
  -> Possible model...
     Embed google docs etc. in iFrame for longer data rather than posting data directly. (x)
     
     Other workaround would involve putting data at a secret URL and directing GAS to fetch it, but that
     will expose a substantial security hole and given we're working with student data, seems like a bad plan.

Step 1.a: Google Embed Widget:
- Create a widget for embedding a google doc or a google sheet with data we care about. (x)

Step 1.b: Get basic property saving/getting working (x)


Step 2: Teacher set-up
- Link assessments in (read-mode?)
- Create necessary "database" (spreadsheets?).
- Set up system for spreadsheets + data cached in user's browser (?)

2A:
-> Data types...
    - Class list (list of classes)
    - Skills list
    - Portfolio Editor
      -> Associate skills w/ exemplars (points + due dates)
      -> Weight whole thing...
      -> Get portfolio editor sheet widget working:
             NOTES: Attempts to use various grid table widgets is a f**ing nightmare. Maybe worth just building
             from scratch after all -- state management is the crux of it and it's not being simplified by using
             other people's code :(


Step 3: Student set-up
- Allow student to link an assignment to a skill / multiple skills.
- Allow teacher to link a student assignment to a skill / multiple skills.
