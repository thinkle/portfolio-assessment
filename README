A project to manage google docs + portfolio assessment system.

What do we need...

Google sheets -> author our strands, etc.
Google classroom connect -> create portfolio / connect pieces (?)
Chrome extension -> connect w/ aspen
Database or Google Docs DB ->
         TABLES

         PER CLASS
         Skill -> Strand -> Descriptors -> # exemplars (display)
         Assignments -> Suggested skill (many-to-many)

         Data model is...

         Skill -> Strand -> Show-By-Date (?)
         Skill -> Strand -> Show-By-Date (?)
         Skill -> Strand -> Show-By-Date (?)

         PER STUDENT
         Skill -> Exemplar -> Reflection -> ID?

         PER TEACHER
         Student -> Work -> Skill -> Assessment


DESIGN
Let's (temporarily?) plan to build backend/frontend with a clean interface so they can be decoupled at a later date. For now, let's plan this...

Backend -> Google Apps Script based API like we use for aspen. Use this API to access classroom, sheets, etc.

Frontend -> Netlify-hosted modern single-page web-app. Might use React? Can (possibly) cache data to avoid making multiple calls to the backend for e.g. rubric descriptors etc.


*Backend methods*

get_table(class,id)
put_table(class,id)


get_classes(student)
get_teacher_classes(teacher)
get_skills(class,assignment)
get_portfolio_assignments(class,student)


update_skills -> create pretty google doc from our output.
update_portfolio -> create pretty portfolio from our output



*Frontend Views*

**Student**
Add assignment...
-> Pick skills...
-> Reflect
-> Submit to teacher

View portfolio
-> Show skills
-> Show "dashboard" (what's done, what are scores, etc.)

**Teacher**
-> View portfolios
   -> By student
   -> By skill
   -> By assignment
   -> By exemplar

-> Assessment to-do list
